### Things to Improve üë∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èüöß

- Change the way repositories are filtered to use a client-side method, possibly utilizing the Github API v4.
- Implement storybooks.
- Improve the UX/UI design.
- Add a Sass mix for the `display:flex` atributte, one with direction `row` and one with direction `column.` when its centered
- Add pagination for repositories or change the request to use the `per_page` header to increase the number of repositories shown.
- Add a `sort by` filter as the API supports a `sort` header parameter.
- Include more information in repository cards, such as stars and the number of commits, to resemble the original Github interface.

### Github Workflows and Husky Hooks

#### Workflows üõë

1. **Configuration Check**:
   - Ensure there is a `.editorconfig` file.
   - Verify `node_modules` and `dist` are gitignored.
   - Check for no ESLint warnings.
   - Validate commit messages.
2. **Sonar Coverage**:
   - Workflow for checking Sonar coverage.
3. **Test Checks**:
   - Ensure all tests pass.

#### Husky Hooks üê∫

1. **pre-commit**:
   - Check that commits are not made on the `main` branch.
   - Run lint-staged to execute `Prettier` and ensure `ESLint` has zero warnings on TypeScript files.
2. **pre-push**:
   - Verify branch names start with `feature/`, `bugfix/`, or `hotfix/`.
3. **commit-lint**:
   - Ensure commit messages start with a capital letter and are between 10 and 72 characters long.
